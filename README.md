# camel-boot
A seed-project for starting new REST-API Camel/Spring Boot projects

This project is to be used to kick-start Camel/Spring-Boot projects (e.g. microservices) which expose a REST API.  When used in conjunction with [camel-boot-cxf-soap](https://github.com/andrewharmellaw/camel-boot-cxf-soap) (which does the same thing but exposes SOAP APIs) you have a good starter for ten for most microservices you may want to create.

# Acknowledgements
The idea for these projects was pretty much stolen from Netflix's [Karyon](https://github.com/Netflix/karyon).  It then evolved as we built more and more Microservice-based solutions at Capgemini.  

There is little original thought in all that has been pulled together here - we're just sharing the glue, and the build files, and some examples which illustrate best practices.  The core is based on:
 1. [Apache Camel](https://camel.apache.org/)
 1. [Spring-Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/)
 1. Netflix's [Archaius](https://github.com/Netflix/archaius) and [Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/hystrix)
 1. [CodaHale Metrics](https://dropwizard.github.io/metrics/3.1.0/)
